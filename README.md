In this github we conducted experiments for two different models, linear function approximation and Deep Q function approximation. So, within this github repository there are two different notebooks available for the two different models. 
The Linear function approximation implementation can be found in *linear_function.ipynb*<br>
The Deep Q-network implementation can be found in *dqn.ipynb*. 
The result directory is currently not filled, but already made such that the notebooks run without any errors.
